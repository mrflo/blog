# Office hours Brussels January 2014

![Office Hour](public/img/OfficeHour.png)

I met a bunch of entrepreneurs during my [office hours in Brussels last week](http://ohours.org/officehours/73763), 11 exactly, non stop between 1pm till 6pm!

It’s very energizing to see all those men and women who are passionate about what they do and who want to create something in this world. 

Here is a summary of a few of those meetings so that you can have an overview of what it’s like to do an office hour with me.
