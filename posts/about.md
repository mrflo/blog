# About
Who am I? Why this website? What will you find here?
### Who am I?
Hi, I'm Xavier Damman. I'm an entrepreneur and an engineer in computer science. I was born and raised in Belgium, but I now live in San Francisco since 2009. I was the cofounder and CEO of [Storify](http://storify.com) that has been [acquired by Livefyre in September 2013](http://storify.com/storify/storify-acquired-by-livefyre). I'm currently working at Livefyre as the General Manager of Storify. 

### Why this site?
It's long overdue that I get back to blogging. It's not that I don't know what to talk about. I have plenty of things, concepts, ideas that I'd love to share. It's just that it's hard for me to put them down in coherent texts. 

But I figured that I should just take a dive and try. It's probably the best way to get better at it!
