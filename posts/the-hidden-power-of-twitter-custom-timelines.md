# The hidden power of Twitter Custom Timelines
Twitter [announced recently a new feature to create custom timelines](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/custom-timelines-in-tweetdeck). This feature allows you to create custom collections of tweets. Those collections appear on your profile (only in Tweetdeck for now) and have [a unique public URL](https://twitter.com/twittermedia/timelines/400355752109293568) that you can share. You can also [embed them on any site](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2427298,00.asp).

Despite the current limitations, I actually think that the Twitter Custom Timelines have the potential to change the way we use Twitter. Nothing less.

## Twitter Customer Timelines for hashtags

What if every time you would use a hashtag, it would automatically add your tweet to a collection with the name of the hashtag? (If it's the first time that you use that hashtag, it will first create a new custom timeline for you.)

This has two direct benefits:
- You can easily look back to all your tweets about a given conference or on a given topic (e.g. all my tweets with #sxsw or with #startup or with #fr - for saying that the tweet is in French)
- Other users can quickly see on your profile what you are mostly tweeting about recently

But most importantly, it opens the door to **allow other users to only follow a subset of your tweets**. E.g. you could follow only my tweets about startup ([follow @xdamman#startup](https://twitter.com/xdamman/timelines/403231422728503296)) or only my tweets in French ([@xdamman#fr](https://twitter.com/xdamman/timelines/403232035851890689)). Reversely, you could follow all my tweets but unfollow my tweets about #sxsw.

Custom Timelines could be the foundation for a new follow mechanism on Twitter that I believe would greatly improve the signal to noise ratio. Something that many Twitter users have been craving for a long time. Time will tell but I can't wait to see what Twitter will do with this.
