# The hidden power of Twitter Custom Timelines
Twitter [announced recently a new feature to create custom timelines](https://blog.twitter.com/2013/custom-timelines-in-tweetdeck). This feature allows you to create custom collections of tweets. Those collections appear on your profile (only in Tweetdeck for now) and have [a unique public URL](https://twitter.com/twittermedia/timelines/400355752109293568) that you can share. You can also [embed them on any site](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2427298,00.asp).

[Some people thought](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/nov/13/twitter-takes-on-storify-with-custom-timelines) that this would be a "Storify killer", but most realized that it [won't kill Storify](http://www.poynter.org/latest-news/229422/twitters-custom-timelines-wont-kill-storify-but-could-become-robust-filters/) as the capabilities are very different. By definition, Twitter Custom Timelines can only contain tweets. That means that you can't add any other media unless they have been tweeted. And because Facebook doesn't play nicely with Twitter, Instagram photos and videos can't be embedded. 
Another big difference is that you can't reorder tweets in a custom timeline and you can't add your own text in between to give some context and tell a story. So while I'm sure this new feature will certainly fill the need of many, I'm not worried for Storify. If nothing else, it will drive more people to the concept of curation and the users who will be looking for more advanced features will go to Storify.

But this post is not about Storify. It's about the hidden power of the Twitter Custom Timelines. 

## Twitter Customer Timelines for hashtags

What if every time you would use a hashtag, it would automatically add your tweet to a collection with the name of the hashtag? (If it's the first time that you use that hashtag, it will first create a new custom timeline for you.)

This has two direct benefits:
- You can easily look back to all your tweets about a given conference or on a given topic (e.g. all my tweets with #sxsw or with #startup or with #fr - for saying that the tweet is in French)
- Other users can quickly see on your profile what you are mostly tweeting about recently

But most importantly, it opens the door to **allow other users to only follow a subset of your tweets**. E.g. you could follow only my tweets about startup ([follow @xdamman#startup](https://twitter.com/xdamman/timelines/403231422728503296)) or only my tweets in French ([@xdamman#fr](https://twitter.com/xdamman/timelines/403232035851890689)). Reversely, you could follow all my tweets but unfollow my tweets about #sxsw.
