The thing is that when you start explaining something, you can't stop half way. And since I have a bit of professional consciousness, I couldn't let my student goin' back home for the weekend with things half done.

But thanks to my magic nap, it was ok :-)
I was tired though since it was the end of the week and my tiredness was accumulating through the previous days.

Today, we continued the relational algebra. And we applied it to real cases. Almost everyone (they were 12) had the chance to come in front of the class to resolve an exercise. I found out that There are 2 students who really have a low level compares to the others. And three that have a much better level than the average of the class. It's quite difficult to manage that. If you take time to explain things clearly then it's quite boring for the best students, otherwise, the lower end of the students can't follow.

At 12 o'clock, we had a special break. Wine and cheese on behalf of Enrique, a Spanish teacher of mathematics who left us two days before.
