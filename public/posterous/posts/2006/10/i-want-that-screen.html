It's so big. Actually maybe too big. It's fully touchable and has got a pretty interface that allows you to watch TV, listen to music, change the background, and other stuffs.
It's really worth it to <a href="http://www.akihabaranews.com/es/fr/fr/en/review-63-Panasonic%27s+interactive+TV+wall%2C+the+demo.html">watch the demo</a>.
The screen is so big that you always have to walk a few meters to click the next button on the interface :-D
Who has said that technology makes people lazier?
What a beautiful world!
