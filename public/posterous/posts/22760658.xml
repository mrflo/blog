I used to rely on GPRS with my O2 pay and go card on my iPhone. It's<br />
£7.5 a month for unlimited data but the speed is not that great. Just<br />
enough for basic uses like twitter, google reader and alike. Even<br />
Google Maps is usable but nothing outstanding.<p />

Well, for April I wanted to try the service of The Cloud. £6.99 for<br />
one month of unlimited data if you appear to be lucky enough to catch<br />
one of their hotspot.<br />
I work in the city. Probably one of the highest concentration of<br />
potential customer for them. Here there are more blackberries than<br />
trees.<br />
Most of the time though my iPhone can't connect to the hotspot. When<br />
it does it eventually won't get a proper ip address from their dhcp<br />
server.<br />
Let's say that at the end of the week I could manage to check my<br />
emails once.<p />

Today I'm in Waterloo station. Good signal here and I can connect. But<br />
oh surprise it is now asking me or my username and password.<br />
I enter it and it keeps on saying my credentials are incorrect (I've<br />
double checked with the confirmation email I received whe subscribing<br />
to the service on the 27th of March 2008).<p />

All in all, it is definitely not worth it. For £3 pounds more you<br />
should better go for a USB dongle on 3G (btw can't wait for a 3G<br />
iPhone).<br />
Or if you still need to rely on wifi hotspots I would suggest you to<br />
have a loot at open bt.<br />
T mobile looks to be great only if you happen to spend a lot of time<br />
in starbucks coffees ;-)
