I saw it in the plane from Hong Kong to London one month ago and it's very interesting.

For sure we can criticize the movie for many points such as
- This is very an american movie: they emphasize the principal character (Al Gore) a bit too much.  They like glorifying people, for their proudness.
- Every 5 minutes you get an ad for Apple Computers :-D

but these flaws just fade away compares to the importance of the topic.
Al Gore is definitely a very good orator and at the end he's doing a very honorable job with that movie.
