1) The course is structured
2) The explanations were clear
3) The teacher answer to my questions
4) The tests are concordant with the matter we saw during the class
5) The tests are easy
6) In average, I spent X hours to study for each test
7) The content of the course is coherent (the order and the goal of the different themes )
8) The class is boring
9) According to me, the class was too slow (1) or too fast (5)
10) The teacher can get the attention of the audience 
11) In overall, I would rate the course X/10 and the teacher Y/10

And I promised I won't have a look at the results before being in the plane.]]></content:encoded>
