	<content:encoded><![CDATA[It has been a lot of fun to look at all those reactions regarding our action <a href="http://www.HonkAtMe.org">HonkAtMe.org</a><br />Some were highly emotive, many rants, but hopefully also many clever and openmind persons (either on the for than on the against side).<p />From the very beginning (for the courageous who read <a href="http://www.klaxonnemoi.org/reactions">all the reactions -in French-</a> back from July 2007), we knew that our action was not perfect. But still, we made it because it is by far better than nothing. At least we make people think about that issue and more importantly, we do that without hurting anyone (even the car does not have any scratch due to our action).<p />But we read all the reactions carefully and while we did that, we were looking for a way to improve our action. To make it better.<p />So, now it's time to introduce HonkAtMe.org 2.0<br />and we gonna call it "<a href="http://www.ObjectiveLessEmission.org">ObjectiveLessEmission.org</a>".<br />One website to gather all Europeans who dream of greener cars.<br />There will be two stickers:<br />- One for green cars (less than 150gr of CO2 per km; and yes there are family cars which reject less than that)<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>

<br />- And one for red cars (All other vehicle, 4x4 included but not only).<br /><div class='p_embed p_image_embed'>
