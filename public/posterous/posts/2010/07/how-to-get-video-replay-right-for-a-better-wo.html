<div class='post_body'>I am super angry. I used to love watching soccer. Today it&#39;s not fun anymore.<div>Instead of playing and enjoying their time, players are today ready to do anything to win including cheating, acting, and doing anti game faults on purpose. It&#39;s not a sport anymore, it&#39;s a battlefield. Add on top of that imperfect referees who see faults where there is acting and acting where there is fault and you end up with a Worldcup that is no fun anymore to watch.</div> <p /><div><b>How to fix it?</b></div><p /><div>It&#39;s definitely time for using the technology that we have to fix that. And video replay looks like the perfect solution. However there are many arguments against it that I understand. However, they are ways to avoid those problems and benefits will highly overcome those. We just need to get Video Replay right.</div> <p /><div><b>Let&#39;s go straight to the solution:</b></div><div><b><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">&quot;Each coach of each team could ask only once per half time for the video replay, the referee cannot ask for replay&quot;.</span></b></div> <p /><div>Let&#39;s have a look at the main arguments people have against video replay and let&#39;s see why this solution could work:</div><p /><div><ol><li>It&#39;s gonna break the flow of the game<p /> By having only one opportunity to ask for a replay, the teams will think twice before asking for it. Furthermore they will probably use it in situations where the flow is anyway already stopped (with the players being so angry and shouting at the referee). By limiting to one replay per team per halftime, we cap the number of stops to two. Without video replay, there are actually much more stops in the flow with players arguing with referee.<p /> </li><li>People will abuse it<p />Again the limit will prevent this.<p /></li><li>The referee  would abuse it<p />That&#39;s why the referee just cannot ask for video replay. He would be too tempting for him to protect himself from bad decisions and it would break the flow way too much. Moreover, by only giving to the coach of each team the responsibility for asking for replay, it removes pressure on the referee. They won&#39;t be able to say anymore &quot;hey you should have seen this&quot; because the referee could answer &quot;you should have asked for replay then (or not waste your replay for that useless thing 5mn before!)&quot;<p /> </li><li>Poorer countries won&#39;t be able to implement it<p />Indeed some countries won&#39;t be able to equip their stadium with the necessary setup and the FIFA cannot easily control thousand of stadiums. So just make it mandatory for the final round of international events. There are plenty of money for the stadium where these events occur and FIFA can easily control them.</li> </ol></div><p /><div><b>Benefits:</b></div><p /><div><ol><li>Players will stop game the game<p />Today players just need to make sure the referee isn&#39;t looking at them before making antigame faults. If they know there is a camera watching them that can be actually used to replay, you won&#39;t have things like this Kick in the Chest by the Netherlands again Spain.<p /> </li><li>No more complain about the referee<p />Let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;s the number one complain about this worldcup. Having a goal that is not accepted is a terrible thing for a worldcup match. It gets players and viewers around the world angry. We can understand that the referee has a difficult job. It&#39;s definitely not easy. But let&#39;s help him with technology and more importantly let&#39;s share the responsibility with the coach of the two teams.</li> </ol><p /><div><b>Bottom line:</b></div></div><p /><div>I really do hope that they will implement this. I love soccer and I want to continue to love watching it. </div><div>It could be tempting to use video replay but it has to be done right. Video Replay without proper rules would just be worst than not having video replay. If the teams or the referee can abuse it, it would be a terrible experience.</div> <div><i>What do you think?
