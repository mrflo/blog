This picture has been taken in the London tube.<br />
A probably not so happy client of Tiscali tagged other advertises with<br />
a hand made sticker "don't get Tiscali broadband. They get your money<br />
but don't connect you".<p />

I love it.<br />
This is all in a web2.0 fashion where power is shifted to individuals.<p />

Nowadays you should better pay attention to your reputation because<br />
anyone could make a dent to it!<p />

And I think it is a great trend because before companies would only<br />
respect very high profile clients or media representatives. .<br />
And I know what I'm talking about because I used to use the privilege<br />
of owning a media (distributed in 30k copies in Belgium). Strangely<br />
enough, most of client services were taking a special care of us.<br />
Now they will have to take care of everybody. That's much more fair.
