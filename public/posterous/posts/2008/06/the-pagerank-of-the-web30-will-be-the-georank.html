<h3>The PageRank of the Web3.0 will be the GeoRank</h3>

<div class='post_body'>The PageRank is the current metric used by Google to rank websites.
The higher the page rank of your website, the more chance you have to appear on the first results of a search on Google.

The page rank is an absolute value. For all viewers, wherever they are, whatever language they speak, your PageRank is the same.

The web3.0 will radically change the rules. As all content will be geotagged, content will have to be classified using a new metric: the GeoRank. GeoRank will not be an absolute value. It will always be related to the observer*.
Indeed, content that first matters to you, is content related to things which are close to you.
For example, if you search for "reviews", you will expect to first have reviews of restaurants close to you.

* Interesting statement. This sounds more and more like quantum physics where everything is related to the observer.

<strong>Empowering local agents</strong>

Till now, your local bookshop had a hard time with Amazon-like websites. As all these books were globally available, global monsters like Amazon logically succeeded in that business. They can offer better prices and yet deliver at your home in a respectable time.

But if things are GeoRanked, when you will search for the latest Harry Potter book, you will first see places near to you when you can get your copy.
Why would you prefer that than ordering your copy via a global agent?
<ol>
	<li>
<strong>Speed</strong>
Search for the last Harry Potter book. First result: corner bookshop - 1 mile away. Even by feet you will get your copy faster than with an express delivery with Amazon.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Price</strong>
With the gas topping at $200/barril, it will become harder for companies like Amazon to ship on a one-to-many basis at a good economical price tag. It is just not an optimized way of distributing things.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Environment</strong>
Why would you ship a book from USA if there is copy available in your neighborhood?  The environmental footprint is completely different.</li>
	<li>
<strong>Meet people
</strong>After all, we are social animals isn't it?</li>
</ol>
<strong>PageRank will not disappear though, and Google will remain.</strong>
Every change of paradigm never totally burried the previous technology.
TV did not replace the radio, Microsoft did not replace IBM, Google did not replace Microsoft and the next Google will not burry Google neither. But it will take its place on the spot lights...

PageRank will still need to be used for all global content.
If you look for information about global topics, you'd better use Google.</div>
