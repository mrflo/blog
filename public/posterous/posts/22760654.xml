	<content:encoded><![CDATA[This Wednesday 19th of November, Commentag introduced a brand new way to search on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>.

Twitter is platform where more than 3 million people post short messages about what they are doing or thinking.
It's exactly like your status on <a href="http://app.tweetag.com/widgettest.php" target="_blank">facebook</a> except that here most of them are totally public and anyone can follow your updates.
This frenzy ecosystem can be visualized live on the brillant <a href="http://twittervision.com/" target="_blank">TwitterVision</a>.

<em>Wouldn't it be cool if we could tell what all these people are most talking about?</em>

To do so, you can use the impressive <a href="http://twitscoop.com/" target="_blank">Twitscoop</a>. It analyzes words frequencies and gives you the hottest trends live. That's cool.

But what if you want to know what all these people on twitter have to say about, let's say, Obama?
Twitscoop is not gonna be of any help here.

Instead, you can do a search on <a href="http://search.twitter.com/" target="_blank">search.twitter.com</a>. <a href="http://search.twitter.com/?q=obama" target="_blank">A search for Obama</a> will bring you all the tweets talking about Obama in real-time.
That's cool!
But you're probably not going to read all the tweets, there are too many!

Let's go back to my first question: <em>"What people have to say about Obama?"</em>.
Reading the first 10 tweets of the result list will not give you any clue to answer that question.
Indeed, the 10 last persons who published a thought about Obama may not represent the topics that have been discussed lately!

That's exactly where <a href="http://tweetag.com/">Tweetag</a> stands.
Instead
of having to read everything to get a picture of a conversation,
Tweetag applies Commentag technologies to allow you to easily catch up
any discussion about a topic of interest.

<a target="_blank">Try it out by yourself!
