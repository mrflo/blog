<div class='post_body'>"Dear Maximilien Maus de Rolley and Xavier Damman ,
 
Congratulations!! I am pleased to inform you that your business plan has been selected as one of the finalists following the preliminary judging rounds. The Queen's Entrepreneurs' Competition Executive Team would like to invite your team to participate in the final round of competition at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario March 1 st to March 4th, 2007. We received a record number of business plans this year from across the globe and the caliber of the business plans was outstanding.  We have invited the top 16 teams to compete during the final weekend.

This is cool isn't it?

So once I go back to Belgium I will have to go to Canada! It will be a bit of improvisation since I won't have a lot of time to prepare but doesn't matter, it's the way I perform the best.

So this is a crazy week. I have to update that business plan for the 30th of January, I have to submit the business proposal to confirm our participation to two other competitions, I have an Arabic exam this Wednesday (that I think I'm gonna bypass btw), another exam at my faculty (in Spanish) this Thursday, and I'm leaving Madrid this Friday to Burundi. 
So I have to pack my bags, and move all my stuff off my apartment. Moreover, I'm supposed to find books for the university of Ngozi, and I'm supposed to prepare the classes I'm gonna give over there. All of this in one single week. 
Life is crazy and actually, that's the way I appreciate it the most.

I really apologize to my friends at KotAstro who are goin' to wait till the 6th of March before seeing me.
But I'm sure they will understand my position.</div>
