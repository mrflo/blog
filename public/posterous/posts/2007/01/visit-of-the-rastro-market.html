<div class='post_body'>Last night, Xavier promised me to wake up at 8am.
Finally, at 10 he woke up. I took my shower and went to buy some breed. I manage it alone although I don't speak Spanish! :-)

After the breakfast, we took the train to go to the famous Rastro market.
It's a market where you can find a lot of different things. From knives, to nails and screw, to power plugs, to dvd, old video tapes, scarves, gloves, t-shirts. Lot of things!

The Rastro market takes place every Sunday from 9am to 3pm between Embajadores y Latina (Madrid).
To know more about it, <a href="http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastro">have a look at wikipedia.</a>

At the end, we bought only three things. Here is the list:
- Xavier bought a blank DVD, and the super Magic Groomer (seen on TV!) (a gift for Boumcke. He will definitely understand why when he will see it. Boumcke, if your read this, move your feet here. Your gift is waiting for you!).
- I bought new gloves. This time I won't loose them!
- Xavier bought me earrings! Thanks a lot :-)

We also found that strange ball. It's an optical-illusion. Really weird.
