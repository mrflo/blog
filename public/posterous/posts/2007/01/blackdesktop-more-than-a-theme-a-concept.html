<h3>Blackdesktop: more than a theme, a concept</h3>

<div class='post_body'>I don't know about you, but for me, using productively a computer since they allow you to make multiple tasks in parallel, is impossible.
On my computer, as in life, I like doing a lot of things in the same time.
So I start working on a Word document, then I remember I had to send a mail to someone, then I remember I had to check this on the net, then I got someone on my pager nudging me, then NetNewsWire informs me that there are new posts on my subscribed RSS feeds, ...
Eventually after 2 hours I will have finished my simple task I had to do at the beginning (writing a simple Word document).

<em>Normal desktop. How to be distracted with that?
</em>
Who said that computers make you gain time?

So, here is the solution.

The blackdesktop concept.
It's not a black wallpaper. It's more like a black curtain where you put in front only one application. The one you use.
When you switch to any other application, the previous one fades behind the curtain.
Obviously, it's way more productive that way. At least for me since I'm less distracted that way.

Wanna do the same on your Mac?
- <a href="http://macupdate.com/info.php/id/15426">Backdrop 1.4</a> (the black curtain, actually you can choose the color)
- <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/16640">MenuShade 1.1</a> (to hide the menu bar at the top. It comes back when you put your mouse on it)
- <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/15844">Spirited away 0.5</a> (to hide the inactive applications. Don't forget to exclude Backdrop!)

Enjoy, and let me know if your productivity has risen with that! :-)</div>
