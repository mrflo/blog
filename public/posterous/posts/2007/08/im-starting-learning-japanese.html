<div class='post_body'>Here we are! I've finally taken my courage in my hands and I start learning Japonese. A whole program!

I'm fortunate though as my girlfriend, Mari, is giving me a special course every evening.
I try to keep the rhythm of 10 new signs a day (10 hiraganas).
But this is theory. Because since I've started (last Wednesday, so 5 days ago), I've learned 25 hiraganas only :-(
Argh!

Ok, here there are (just for fun)
あいうえお
かきくけこ
さしすせそ
たちつてと
なにぬねの

That's a good beginning ;-)

I just would like to mention a very great tool to learn such different language.
It's called Provoc (screenshot beneath) and it's, of course, only for Mac. It helps you memorize vocabulary for any foreign language you may wish to learn.
I'm building my own Provoc file with, at the moment, only hiragana signs and 26 simple vocabulary.
