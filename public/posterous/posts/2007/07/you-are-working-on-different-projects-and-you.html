<div class='post_body'>I know I'm not the only one who like doing thousand things at one time.<br />I've always 36 windows opened simultaneously and my workflow is always interrupted by many web IRQ such as twitter, gtalk, msn, email and so on...<p />This situation results to a productivity drop. The very first symptom being that famous question at the end of the day "What the hell have I done today?". <p />Months ago <a href="http://www.xavierdamman.be/blog/2007/01/02/blackdesktop-more-than-a-theme-a-concept/">I've written a post</a> about a way to improve that situation using a very clean desktop (unicolor wallpaper, no menu bar, and one application at a time using <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/info.php/id/15844">Spirited Away</a> for MacOSX).<p />I was using this for a while but now I've come up with a brand new idea that I think is even more productive:<p />Create one user per project.<p />It's a kiss (Keep It Simple &amp; Stupid) idea and it changed my life (... or not, but at least it made me more productive on my different projects).<p />Why is that great?<br />First, it is simple. Even Windows users have this functionality built-in on Windows XP!<br />Second, it allows you to only see documents, emails, contacts, images, that have a direct link with your project.<p />Example:<br />I've now two users on my MacBook: xdamman (the administrator and main one) and KlaxonneMoi, dedicated to the <a href="http://www.klaxonnemoi.org">KlaxonneMoi.org</a> project. <br />When I switch to the latter account my emails, IM contacts, photos (on iPhoto) and so on are only relevant for that project.<br />So, when I open Firefox, I've only bookmarks and saved loggins and passwords for my <a href="mailto:xdamman@klaxonnemoi.org">xdamman@klaxonnemoi.org</a> accounts (either on gmail, scoopeo, youtube, ...).<p />When I need to exchange files between my main account and the new one, I just use the drop box (/Users/klaxonnemoi/Public/Drop box). It works fine!<p />I'm not interrupted by my main contacts (family, friends, ...) when I'm working on the project, and I don't have to deal with private mails and photos and all these stuffs that put my attention away of my workflow.<p />The only issue is the memory usage. As applications stay open when you switch user, the memory usage increases. Better to have one giga of memory (I've only 756MB and it is limit).<p /><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/workflow%20multitasking%20macosx%20productivity" class="performancingtags" rel="tag"></a></div>
