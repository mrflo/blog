<div class='post_body'>Wow, I'm really don't write post on a regular basis. Too bad.<br />Anyway, here are the latest news:<p />1) I've been graduated: I can now handle the title of Civil Engineer in Computer Science. Oh, btw, I even got a grade: "distinction" (it was really unexpected though).<p />2) Mari is back in Belgium! She's gonna stay here till the 29th of September.<br />Â It's really cool!<p />3) We just came back from a one week holidays in France with our bicycles! We only cycled 254km though (we made some shortcuts by bus). It was really funny and we had very good time. We staid in a very cool camping hold by a very kind a generous family in Choiseul. They propose bio food and it was so good! If you travel around Nancy, you should definitely make the detour to Choiseul (<a href="http://www.paradis-vert.com">although their website is really crappy at the moment</a>).<p />4) Tonight, we go to Nathan's house. He's waiting for us with a geant couscous! Can't wait! Then, we'll directly go to Spa till Sunday for the <a href="http://www.francofolies.be">Francofolies</a>!<p /><a href="http://www.KlaxonneMoi.org">KlaxonneMoi.org</a> is launched. We sold 120 stickers and printed one thousand (so far). <a href="http://www.KlaxonneMoi.org/reactions">Check the rants</a> (in French), there are funny!</div>
