<div class='post_body'>Today, it was my very last class. So I asked my student to evaluate me. Since it was my very first time I gave course, I wanted
I gave them 11 statements they had to rate from 1 (I fully disagree) to 5 (I fully agree).

1) The course is structured
2) The explanations were clear
3) The teacher answer to my questions
4) The tests are concordant with the matter we saw during the class
5) The tests are easy
6) In average, I spent X hours to study for each test
7) The content of the course is coherent (the order and the goal of the different themes )
8) The class is boring
9) According to me, the class was too slow (1) or too fast (5)
10) The teacher can get the attention of the audience 
11) In overall, I would rate the course X/10 and the teacher Y/10
They had to answer on a blank page without putting their names. It was anonymous (in order to have real critics).
And I promised I won't have a look at the results before being in the plane.</div>
