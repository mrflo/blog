<div class='post_body'>The trip back home passed almost flawlessly... 
So we left Ngozi at 8 am this Friday (yesterday). I had to go for one last time to the university to say bye to all but Apollinaire didn't have the time for that short way around.
I was a bit angry with that since I thought it was a bit unflexible from Apollinaire's part, and second, I had promised to Bénédicte to see her at the university because she had to give some letters to post from Europe.
And moreover, I didn't say bye to the others... so it was a bit bitter to leave everybody this way.

<em>The beach of the Tanganyika lake, and the plane from Bujumbura</em>

Anyway. So we went down to Bujumbura in Apolinaire's new suzuki 4x4. A trip of more than 2 hours. 
In Bujumbura, it's definitely way more hot than in Ngozi. I was sweating! 
We had to go here and there for Apolinaire's business and then we ate at 1pm and then we went a few minutes on the beach of the lac Tanganyika.
A quite peaceful place. But I couldn't stay there for more. It was really hot.

After that I took the plane towards Addis Ababa (Ethiopia). The flight is like a bus. It makes a stop at Entebbe (Ouganda) during half hour. Just the time to fill the plane.
At Addis Ababa, I had to wait for 5 hours. Hopefully I was with french young journalist who had their flight at around midnight (mine was at 2am). So we had some Ethiopian beers which helped us to pass the time :-)

At 2 we entered the plane and flew for a 7h30 journey. We landed at 7am local time at Heathrow (London). And then I miss my plane and had to take the next one for Madrid (see my next post).</div>
