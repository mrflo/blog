<div class='post_body'>One day is not like another here. But if it could, I would like it to be like this Tuesday.
Since yesterday it was a bit chaotic (see my last post), I decided to plow through it. And it worked!
I achieve to give a good class today. I was as good as I was bad yesterday ;-)
I had prepared a bit last night, and therefore, I was way more confident in my structure, in the things I had to teach. And consequently, everything flowed like water. Which leads definitely to a better quality class.
So today, I explained SQL queries for the morning class, and I've started PHP with the second class.
I had to explain what is a variable, and what is an array.
They have no experience in programming (although they are in third year of computer science!).
But it turned to be ok and it's very motivating to see how much they learn in a lesson!</div>
