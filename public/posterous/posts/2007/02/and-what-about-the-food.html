</p>In such experiences, the food you eat is quite very important. I mean whatever can happen to you, if your belly is full, it's ok (at least for me). So, you are wondering and what about the food that guy is eating over there?<p><!--more--></p>
I eat very well. I've got good breed for the breakfast, for lunch and super I have a very very good soup and a meal with rice and beans. Sometimes with beef, sometimes with potatoes, sometimes with bananas (!!).
So it's really ok. I can say I eat well.
The point is that there is not a lot of variety in the meals.
Every day, it's quite the same. One day, we'll have potatoes or bananas. It's the only source of diversification actually! ;-)

The very good thing is that they have a lot of fruits.
Pineapples, bananas, "avocats". They are delicious! :-)</div>
