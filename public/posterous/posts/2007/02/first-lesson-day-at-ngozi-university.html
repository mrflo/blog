<div class='post_body'>Amis francophones, je suis désolé mais ce post, comme les suivants relatifs à mon travail ici au Burundi, seront en anglais.
Devant faire un rapport d'activité à la fin de mon séjour (en espagnol ou anglais), cela me fera gagner du temps.
Ca tombe bien, car j'en ai justement pas beaucoup ;-)

So, here we are.
Tuesday 6th, was my very first class day. I prepared myself the whole weekend for that. I really worked a lot to get things organized in my head. But still, I only had time to prepare the class of Databases 1. I didn't have time enough to prepare as I would the class of databases 2.

<p><!--more--></p>
From 8 to 12, I gave Databases 1 to about 20 students. There were all very polite. They all listen carefully, something you'll never see in Europe. About 4 students were really participative. I tried to ask very often for questions, feedback or simply to answer my questions. Just to focus the attention of the audience. It was very pleasant. "Sobre todo", the feeling of being useful for them and that, thanks to you, they've learned new things, is just priceless. It gives you happiness, definitely.

I've used a homemade slide show to present (prepared during the weekend). After the 2 first hours, they told me that it was a bit fast (although it was way slower than what we are used to in our european universities). So, the 2 last hours of the morning, I've just repeated what we've seen so far but only using the white board.
Overall, I think it's a very good way to get things explained well. That way, people have much more time to think about what you say and what you are drawing.
At the end of that morning, I was ver happy. I was really confident that they understood what I've taught them (thanks to my continuous questions to check that) and therefore, all the energy I've put (especially the third and fourth hour) were worth it.
The bad thing is that I was really exhausted. It was really 4 intensive hours and no time to take a nap to get some rest.

The afternoon, I had only half class. The third year, the ones that already had the course Database 1 one year ago.
They were 7 although they should normally be twice. Maybe the others will join for the end of the week (somes have to come back from Congo).

As I said, I didn't have time during the weekend to prepare as I should that class. So, I had no slideshow to present that class.
Nevertheless, I knew what I wanted to do and I presented on the blackboard.
First the project we will do during these 3 weeks, then the overall architecture of a Web Application (since they will have to develop a database in MySQL and a PHP page to interact with).
It was damn difficult to explain them that. I really didn't expect that. Only 2 students had already launched Internet Explorer.
Try to explain the architecture of a Web Application to students that just don't know what google is.
After the two first hours, it was done, and I decided to use the two last hours (from 4 to 6pm) to let them working by group for their project (to save a bit my energy). I just passed from group to group to guide them.

At the end, I was not that happy of myself for this afternoon (it was not that bad, but compared to the very nice morning it was really not the same satisfaction).

After that I went to the cybercafe for half an hour, just the time to send and receive my mails (it's a 14Kbps connection, shared between 10 computers). Then, back home using the Taxi Velo for 0,20€. Really nice.
I was really exhausted. Not able to do anything using my brain. So, no time to prepare my classes for tomorrow.
I just ate and talked with Julien (a 25-year French guy that just arrived yesterday that will stay for 2 years, giving Law courses) and with Jean-Pierre. The son of the owner of the hotel I stay. He's really friendly and always try to help me.

My conclusion is that 8 hours a day is way too much, definitely. I mean, it's should be ok if you just give class like in Belgium. If you just pass your slideshow, explaining 3 mn by slide, without using the black board. That way it should be possible.
But if you really want to give a quality class, to give the best you can to share what you can share, if you always try to focus the attention of the audience, if you always try to think about an other way to explain the same concept just to have things cristal clear. Then, just forget about it.

And as a new teacher, a beginner, I've put too much energy to make things as good as I could.
So, wait and see. Tomorrow I'll save a bit more my energy and we'll see. Maybe it's just that I'm not used to. If it's not ok, I will ask to reduce my charge to 6 hours.
I mean, it serves no one's interest to give more if it is not quality.

Now it's 11pm and I'm going to sleep. Tomorrow, get up at 6:15pm. At 7:40 I'll go by foot to the university and start my class at 8.

P.S: I'll try to go every day to the cybercafé for 10mn, just to send and receive my mails and my blog's posts. So, you'll get the updates only one or two days after I wrote them.
P.S2: I've made probably many mistakes in this post. I apologize for that, but I'm too tired to read it again and correct it.</div>
