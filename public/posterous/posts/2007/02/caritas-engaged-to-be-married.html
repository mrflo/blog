This Saturday I was invited to a traditional ceremony which officializes the engagement between the fiancés, called "la dote".
The family of the man have to pay money to the family of the jill to get their "cow" (that's really how they call it!).
It was very nice to participate to such a traditional party. I have recorded many videos. I will share them once I'll be back in Europe (remember that the Internet connection is very bad here).
