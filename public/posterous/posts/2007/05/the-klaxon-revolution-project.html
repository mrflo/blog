<div class='post_body'>Oufti, it has been a long time I didn't write on my blog. Sorry for this. I've been very busy with my thesis. Actually it isn't finished yet. Deadline: 5th of June.

Anyway, here I'm back with a new idea I want to share with you.

My father just bought a SUV (you know those mini big trucks completely useless). At the time of pollution, global warming and so on, it is really a very very bad idea.
I tried to convince him but no way; his choice was made.

So, I decided to fight! (with your help!)
I'm going to launch KlaxonRevolution.org. The aim is simple: Anyone can order stickers with "Je pollue, klaxone-moi!" (I'm polluting, horn me!). These stickers should be put at the rear of SUV cars. Every time you are behind such vehicle and that you see the sticker, just horn! :-)

Of course, I will start with my father's car. And every week I will update KlaxonRevolution.org with the number of times he has been horned during the day.

If you wanna be part of this revolution, be my guest! Anyone is welcomed to stick stickers or to help me build the website or just to communicate!

Spread the word, revolution is coming!</div>
