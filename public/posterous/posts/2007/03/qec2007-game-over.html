<div class='post_body'>The Queen's entrepreneurship Competition is over now.
And with a bit of disappointment, we come empty hands back home.

</span><em>The award ceremony. As you can see, it was really a jetset like event ;-)</em>

Everything had started so well though. On Friday, the first round of the competition, there were two pools of 8. And we finished first of our pool. So we were selected to participate to the final on Saturday with five other teams.

As most of the selected teams, we didn't party Friday night. Instead, we came back at the hotel to tweak our prototype.
We eventually finished it and we couldn't wait to show it to the panel of judge.

We did the same keynote then the day before. We just added the presentation of the prototype and the audience was thrilled. 
The audience, except the jury.
Their very first question was: "Hummm... I'm sorry but I don't think I've understood very well. What's the product you are selling?".
Which is the worst question ever you can get receive after a 20-mn keynote about your business plan.

The think is that that jury was less Web 2.0 oriented and they didn't get the opportunity. 
The pain has we have described it (the fact that 40M people do have a webcam but they just can do one application with them), didn't sound to them as it did with the previous jury.
Most of them probably don't have a webcam at home.

So we should have presented it other way. With a security point of view only. So, it's definitely our fault.
And that's the reason why we are really disappointed. 
Especially when we see the reaction of the public (majority of university students). They were all thrilled about our idea.
Even one was almost asking us an autograph since he was so convinced we were going to be the next YouTUBE. And many asked us my blog's address to keep in touch with the next steps of our project.

But still, we really learned A LOT during this weekend. 
It really worth it to be there and to get the comments on our business plan by the most famous business man of Canada (the CEO of Westjet, CEO of Coca-Cola Canada, and many others as famous).
