	<content:encoded><![CDATA[Here we are.

You are all waiting for the next story isn't it?
Is Xavier tuckered out his second day? What an unsustainable suspense! At least you can imagine that I'm still alive since I wrote these lines.

So, I woke up at 6:30am. I slept much better than the previous night since I used my earmuffs to avoid the neighbor's radio at 5 and the cock at 4:30 ;-)
But still, I wasn't like totally ok. I was still a bit tired.
I took my (damn) cold shower and my breakfast. Then, to the university. I took a taxi bicycle for 150F (less than 0,15â‚¬). It was quite funny since the first driver told me "it's 50,000F!", well tried dude ;-)
With that "transportation", I need (only) half time to get to the university (10 minutes).

I tried to photocopy the notes of a student that had the course Databases 1 last year.
That simple task that should require 37 seconds, took 30 times more! ;-)

Anyway. The thing is that the students told me yesterday that I should give them notes.
Wow. I didn't know that. Mariano told me that it was quite difficult to make copies, and therefore, that the best is to let student take notes during the class.
The point is that they are not used to take notes on the fly. So, today I started to say exactly what they have to write since I don't have any syllabus in french here. And I just can't do such a syllabus here. It's definitely too much work and I don't have time here to do that.
So, this is one important thing for the followers. You should prepare a (short) syllabus in french (or english, but their english level is quite low) so that you already know exactly what do you have to spell them out.
Because what I do now is just putting my explanations with sentences to be written. But I have to do it on the fly.
So at the end, the students have to structure their notes themselves. Which is obvious for us, but not necessarily for them.

<p><!--more--></p>
So, this morning I've just used the white board. I've started by asking someone to explain briefly what we saw yesterday. It was not that bad actually although I had to precise some little things.
Then I kept on with the relational structure of databases and its formalism with mathematics (Relational Algebra).
After 4 hours, we just finished the Selection function on the set of tuples. It's quite not a fast velocity but it's ok. It took time because I gave everybody (they were only 20 this morning) a chance to go in front of the white board. Which is definitely the best way to ensure that they understand. But when I see backward all the energy, the time, the amount of explanations needed to achieve that, I just can't imagine how should it be if it was in a foreign language. If it is only about practising, then it's definitely ok, but if you have to explain concepts that are not straight-forward, it should be much more difficult.

At 10h, there is normally what is known as the Tea-break. But actually there was no tea at all at the university. Argh, so I kept with water. After two hours of talking, you really need to drink. Just imagine after 8 hours. The result? 1,5 liters a day, just between 8am and 6pm! ;-)

One thing that surprises me is that the student of the third course who already attended the Databases1 class last year, are following my class like the others. Almost like if they've never had any lesson on that topic. The thing is that not only they've never done any practise on that topic, but they just don't have any practise at all. Most of them just couldn't explain what's a server, what's a client (now they can). So, I took time to explain them these "basic" things and I think it worths the time it takes.
They still have a lot to learn, but although the tren is very slow I'm confident it is on good tracks. And for me this far most important than achieving reaching the next train station.

The afternoon I've made an introduction to the HTML language. Although it's not the purpose of the course DB2, it was a necessary evil in order to give them all the tools they will have to use for their project.
At the end of the 4 hours, they were all able to create a very simple html page. You can't imagine all the obstacles we had to pass through to achieve that. For most of them, it was their very first time they open Internet Explorer.

It's 11:22pm and I'm gonna stop my post here since it's time to sleep. Tomorrow, I'll wake up at 6:20 or something.
From now on, I'll give (only) 6 hours a day instead of 8 (I got the agreement of the responsible of the university today). That way, I'll have time to prepare my next classes. Which is better not only for me, but for all.

Here is some others pics of the amazing landscape we have just in front of the university.

(I apologize for the poor image size and quality but I really have to compress a lot since the internet connection is really crappy. In average, I have something like 2Kb/s!!!)]]></content:encoded>
